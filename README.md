# Laravel Multi-Tenant Roles
This Laravel 5.5+ package provides an implementation of roles and permissions in a multi-tenant application.
It borrows a lot from [Entrust](https://github.com/Zizaco/entrust). Although all the Entrust functionalities are not yet implemented here, the roadmap includes doing so.
The intend is for Laravel Multi-Tenant Roles to provide the following improvement (over Entrust):
* ## Multi-Tenancy "out of the box".
* ## Localization. Being able to provide a display name and descriptions for a role or permission in whatever language your Laravel application supports.
# Work in progress
